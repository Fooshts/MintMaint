# MintMaint
I want to be lazy making sure my Linux Mint system is up-to-date, clean, and smooth. Why not make something that does that for me with a click of a button?
Not responsible if this breaks your system, it worked on mine. Don't cry if it doesn't on yours. Troubleshoot it like I did lol

I run it via Terminal in whatever folder it winds up.
python3 Main.py

Add & if you want to close your terminal window. idc either way.
